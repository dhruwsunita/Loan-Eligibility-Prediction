# Loan-Eligibility-Prediction
### Overview:
This project aims to predict the eligibility of individuals for loans based on various factors using machine learning techniques. Predicting loan eligibility is a common problem faced by banks and financial institutions, and this project provides a solution using Python programming language and popular machine learning algorithms.


### Dataset 
The dataset used for this project contains information about individuals including their gender, marital status, education, employment, income, loan amount, loan term, and credit history. The target variable is whether the individual's loan application was approved or not.
