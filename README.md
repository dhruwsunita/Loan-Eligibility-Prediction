### Dataset 
The dataset used for this project contains information about individuals including their gender, marital status, education, employment, income, loan amount, loan term, and credit history. The target variable is whether the individual's loan application was approved or not.

### Features
- Data Preprocessing: The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features.
- Model Building: Several machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Tree Classifier are trained on the preprocessed data to predict loan eligibility.
- Model Evaluation: The models are evaluated using various performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and score to assess their effectiveness.

### Requirements
- Python 3.11s
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
